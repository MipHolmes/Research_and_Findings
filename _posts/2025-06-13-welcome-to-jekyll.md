In my very first blog post I'll be providing an overview of a finding for a recent offensive engagement. 

When my company lands these type of jobs, the scope typically consists of vuln assessment (VA), internal and external network, social engineering, and the basis of this post, web. 

The client utliizes a Y2K-era website: basic HTML, significantly unmaintained frameworks, and of course a monolithic architecture. I figured this would be a goldmine for class web app vulnsâ€”SQLi, XSS, you name it. I was wrong. Days went by and no successful exploits were performed. From this point, I took the "low-hanging fruit" route and analyzed several CVEs that a ZAP scan flagged.

Among one of these were a prototype pollution (PP) vulnerability due to an outdated jQuery library. 

What is prototype pollution?


```javascript
$.extend(true, {}, JSON.parse('{ "__proto__": { "attacker": "yes" } }' )); 
console.log({}.attacker);
```
